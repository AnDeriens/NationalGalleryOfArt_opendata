# The National Gallery of Art Open Data Program

The [National Gallery of Art](https://www.nga.gov) serves the United States by welcoming all people to explore and experience art, creativity, and our shared humanity. In pursuing our mission, we make as much data as possible available to scholars, educators, and the general public in support of research, teaching, and personal enrichment; to promote interdisciplinary research; to have fun and be creative; and to help people understand what inspires great works of art.

## Public Domain Collection Data – Creative Commons

The Gallery’s open data program is a natural extension of our mission. We believe that increased access to factual data about works of art fuels knowledge, scholarship, and innovation, inspiring uses that transform the way we discover and understand the world of art.

We respect all intellectual property rights and comply with applicable copyright law, including the exemption from copyright restrictions under the doctrine of fair use. We respect the privacy and publicity rights of individuals and abide by provisions in donor and purchase agreements that may restrict publication of sensitive and personal information in our collection data. We have safeguards in place to protect confidential information from being released in the public data set, so you will find it is incomplete, by design. We consider all other factual statements about our works of art to be in the public domain, so we release that data with a [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

Our public domain collection dataset provides data records for the 130,000+ artworks in our collection, as well as the artists who created them. You can download the full dataset free of charge without seeking authorization from the Gallery.

The dataset is published in CSV format and uses UTF-8 encoding. It is compressed with LZW compression to permit the files to be downloaded without any special tools and can be decompressed with commonly available file unzipping tools. A [data dictionary](https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/openaccess/blob/master/documentation) fully describes the dataset.

## Additional usage guidelines

### Images are covered by a different policy

While links and references to images and other media such as audio and video files are contained in this dataset, the images and media files are not included under this program. See the Gallery's Open Access Policy for more information about image and media copyright.

### Our collection data is in constant flux

Our collection management is a process in continuous motion and therefore the dataset released through this program will never be entirely complete, correct, or up to date. This data is provided “as is”, it is updated frequently (usually once a week) and should be used at your own risk. The National Gallery of Art makes no representations or warranties of any kind. If you notice erroneous data in our public dataset, please [let us know](https://www.nga.gov/contact-us/ask-a-question.html).

## Giving back
Please consider attributing or citing the National Gallery of Art's Public Domain Collection Dataset when using this data for research purposes but please do not use the Gallery's logo or imply that the Gallery endorses your work without first acquiring our permission.
